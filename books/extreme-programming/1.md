# 1. What is XP?

---

XP is about:

- social change
- letting go of habits and patterns that were adaptive in the past
  - now get in the way of us doing our bets work
- giving up the defences that protect us
  - but interfere with our productivity
- feeling exposed
- being open
  - what we are capable of doing
    - then doing it
    - allowing others do the same
  - finding our adult place in the larger world
  - becoming more of our best selves
  - in the process our best as developers

Relationship:

- good relationship, good business
- productivity & confidence: related to human relationships
- need both technique & good relationship at work activities, coding, ...
- XP addresses both

Success:

- be prepared
- do **not protect yourself** from success by holding back
- do your best, deal with the consequences
- extreme
- leave yourself exposed
  - someone may feel scared
  - for others, it's daily life
  - this is why there are polarized reactions to XP

XP as style of software development:

- focusing on excellent application of
  - programming techniques
  - clear communication
  - teamwork
- allows us to accomplish something we could not imagine

XP includes:

- philosophy of software development based on
  - values of communication
  - feedback
  - **simplicity**
  - courage
  - respect
- body of practices improving software development
  - complement each other
  - amplifying their effects
- set of complementary principles, intellectual techniques
  - for translating the values into practice
  - useful when no practice for your particular problem

XP as a path of improvement with great people:

- **short dev cycle**
  - resulting early, concrete, continuing feedback
- incremental planning approach
  - quickly comes up with an overall plan that expected to evolve in the life of the project
- ability to flexibly schedule of implementation of functionalities
  - responding to changing business needs
- reliance on automated tests by programmers, customers, testers
  - to monitor the progress of project
  - to allow the system to evolve
  - to catch defects as early as possible
- reliance on oral communication, tests, source code
  - to communicate system structure and intent
- reliance on an evolutionary design process
  - which last as long as the system last
- reliance on the close collaboration of actively engaged individuals with ordinary talents
- reliance on practices for
  - short-term instincts of the team members
  - long-term interests of the project

1st edition of this book:

- XP: lightweight methodology for small-to-medium-sized team development software in the face of vague or rapidly changing requirements
- five years later (current version):
  - XP much further than the original definition:

## eXtreme Programming

- lightweight
  - only do what you need to do
    - to create value for the customer
    - you cannot carry a lot of baggage and move fast
    - But, NO freeze-dried software process
  - body of technical knowledge necessary to be an outstanding team is large and growing
- methodology based on addressing constraints in software dev
  - does not address
    - project portfolio management
    - financial justification of projects, operations, marketing or sales
    - XP has implication of all of above, but does not work directly
  - methodology
    - often translated as: `a set of rules to follow that guarantee success`
    - but it does NOT work like programs
      - think people are NOT computers
      - thus, every team does XP differently with varying degrees of success
- XP adapts to vague or rapidly changing requirements
  - good for this situation
    - since requirements need to change to adapt to rapid shifts in the modern business world
    - BUT, teams have also successfully used XP where:
      - requirements does NOT seem **volatile** (e.g. porting project)

eXtreme Programming is...

> to reconcile humanity and productivity as a practice of software development, to share that reconciliation.

or,

> a software discipline that addresses risk ast all levels of the development process

- the more humanely I treat myself and others,
- the more productive we all become.

key to success:

- not self-mortification
- but, in acceptance that we are people in a person-to-person business

How XP address the risk in the development processes

- **schedule slips**
  - XP: short release cycles, thus scope of any slip is limited
  - one-week iteration of customer-requested features + fine grained feedbacks (about progress)
  - plans with short tasks, team can resolve problem within the cycle
  - implement highest priority first
    - even if slips happened these would be lower value
- **project canceled**
  - XP: enforces short-release cycles to business-oriented part of the team
  - this makes less to go wrong before deploying
- **system goes sour**
  - XP: comprehensive suite of automated tests
    - run / rerun after every change (many times in a day) to ensure quality baseline
  - XP: keeps the system in deployable condition
    - problems are not allowed to accumulate
- **defect rate**
  - XP: writing tests function-by-function
  - Customers: writing tests program-feature-by-program-feature
- **business misunderstood**
  - XP: calls for business-oriented people to be first-class members of the team
  - _spec._ of the project is continuously refined during dev.
    - learning by customer
    - team can reflect this in the software
- **business changes**
  - XP: shorten release cycle
    - less change during development of a single release
- **false feature rich**
  - XP: only highest priority tasks are addressed
- **staff turnover**
  - XP: ask programmers to accept responsibility for estimating and completing their own work
    - gives them feedback actual time taken because
      - the estimate can be improved
      - then we can respect these estimations
      - when the roles for who can make / change estimation is clear, then
        - less chance for a programmer to get frustrated by being asked to do obviously impossible
  - XP: encourages human contact amongst the team
    - reducing the loneliness that is often at the heart of job dissatisfaction
  - XP: incorporates an explicit model of staff turnover
    - new team members: encouraged to gradually accept more responsibility. interact each other or exisitng programmers
